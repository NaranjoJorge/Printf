.SH NAME
_printf - format and print data
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf() produce output according to a format as described below. The functions printf() write output to stdout.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.SH FORMAT OF THE FORMAT STRING
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
.SH THE CONVERSION SPECIFIER
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

d, i

The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

s

The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').

%

A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

c

The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

b

The unsigned int argument is converted to binary.

o, u, x, X

The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.
.SH EXAMPLE

#include "holberton.h"

int main()

{

char *s= "and the mountains have no roads.";

_printf("The garden is full of rosses %s", s);

}

./_printf
The garden is full of rosses and the mountains have no roads.
.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
